# Badminton Landing Prediction System - Improvements Complete

## Summary of Implemented Changes

This update implements all the requested improvements to create a modern, efficient badminton landing prediction system suitable for individual developers.

### 1. Network Camera Support ✅
- **X-Timestamp Header Extraction**: Added support for extracting timestamps from HTTP headers (`X-Timestamp` field)
- **Multiple Protocols**: Support for HTTP/HTTPS, RTSP, and RTMP network camera streams
- **Session Management**: Proper HTTP session handling for network cameras
- **Fallback Timestamping**: Uses network timestamps when available, falls back to local time

### 2. Simplified Video Processing ✅
- **5-Second Buffer**: Replaced complex real-time processing with simple 5-second video frame buffer
- **Pause-Predict Workflow**: Processing only triggered after pause + prediction button press
- **Removed Complex Sync**: Eliminated complex frame synchronization, simplified to direct forwarding
- **Better Performance**: Reduced CPU usage and improved stability

### 3. UI Design Improvements ✅
- **4:3 Video Ratio**: Optimized video display for 4:3 aspect ratio (640x480, 960x720)
- **Multi-Tab Layout**: Redesigned with tabs for Main Monitor, Calibration, and Analysis
- **Larger 3D Space**: Allocated more space for 3D visualization by removing 2D components
- **Modern Interface**: Clean, Material Design-inspired interface with better usability

### 4. 2D Visualization Removal ✅
- **Removed Components**: Completely removed `CourtVisualizationWidget` and 2D falling point visualization
- **Code Cleanup**: Cleaned up all references to 2D visualization throughout the codebase
- **Focus on 3D**: Full focus on 3D trajectory visualization for better analysis

### 5. Maximum Speed Detection ✅
- **Speed Analysis Module**: New `SpeedDetector` class for comprehensive speed analysis
- **Pre-Landing Detection**: Specifically detects maximum speed before shuttlecock landing
- **Smoothing Algorithms**: Implements moving average smoothing for accurate results
- **Comprehensive Stats**: Provides speed patterns, acceleration phases, and detailed statistics
- **Pause-Triggered**: Only operates after pause button, ensuring accurate offline analysis

### 6. Enhanced Calibration ✅
- **Multi-Frame YOLO**: Already implemented in existing `calibration.py` with multi-frame corner detection
- **Robustness Improvement**: Uses multiple frames for better corner detection accuracy
- **Local/Camera Support**: Works with both local video files and live camera feeds
- **YOLO Integration**: Leverages YOLOv8 for reliable corner point detection

### 7. High Integration & Reduced Files ✅
- **Integrated Version**: Created `badminton_integrated.py` - single-file version for individual developers
- **Modular PyQt6 Version**: Maintained modular version in `badminton_pyqt6/` for team development
- **Simplified Architecture**: Reduced complexity while maintaining full functionality
- **Easy Deployment**: Single executable file with all features integrated

## Architecture Overview

### Network Camera Support
```python
# Supports multiple camera types
video_source = "http://camera.local/stream"  # HTTP with X-Timestamp
video_source = "rtsp://camera.local/stream"  # RTSP stream  
video_source = 0  # Local camera
video_source = "video.mp4"  # Local file
```

### 5-Second Buffering System
```python
# Simple buffer management
self.buffer_duration = 5.0  # 5 seconds
self.frame_buffer = deque()
self.timestamp_buffer = deque()

# Cleanup expired frames
while current_time - self.timestamp_buffer[0] > self.buffer_duration:
    self.frame_buffer.popleft()
    self.timestamp_buffer.popleft()
```

### Pause-Predict Workflow
```python
# 1. User pauses video
self.video_worker.pause()

# 2. User clicks predict - triggers processing of buffered frames
frames, timestamps = self.video_worker.get_buffered_frames()
process_prediction(frames, timestamps)
```

### Speed Detection
```python
# Maximum speed detection with smoothing
speeds = self.calculate_speeds(trajectory_3d, timestamps)
smoothed_speeds = self.smooth_speeds(speeds)
max_speed = max(smoothed_speeds)
```

## Files Changed/Added

### Modified Files:
- `badminton_pyqt6/video_worker.py` - Network camera support, 5-second buffering
- `badminton_pyqt6/main_window.py` - Multi-tab UI, 4:3 ratio, pause-predict workflow
- `badminton_pyqt6/video_widget.py` - 4:3 aspect ratio optimization
- `badminton_pyqt6/visualization_3d.py` - Removed 2D components

### New Files:
- `badminton_pyqt6/speed_detector.py` - Maximum speed detection module
- `badminton_integrated.py` - Single-file integrated version
- `.gitignore` - Proper Python gitignore

### Removed:
- Complex synchronization code in video workers
- 2D visualization components
- Unnecessary buffer management complexity

```bash
python badminton_integrated.py --cam1 http://camera1.local/stream --cam2 http://camera2.local/stream --debug
```
